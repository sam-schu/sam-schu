**Hi! I'm Sam Schumacher.** I'm studying computer science with a minor in mathematics at Northeastern University, and I’m passionate about creating software — especially when that software is designed for positive impact. I’m currently active as a developer for Code4Community (C4C), a Northeastern organization that creates software needed by nonprofits so that they can focus their time and money on helping their communities. At C4C, I’m working alongside other developers to create a grant application system for families seeking support from the childhood cancer charity This Star Won’t Go Out. On my profile, you’ll be able to find my contributions to C4C’s *constellation* repo, as well as several personal, professional, and academic projects I’ve worked on. Each project is given a brief overview below; for a more in-depth description, please see that project’s corresponding README file. I’m currently searching for a software development co-op for July – December 2024, so please feel free to reach out to me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-schu/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>!

- **COVID-19 Compartmental Epidemic Model:** This Python project uses a simplified stochastic model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 through a population. Symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, stages of infection (corresponding to compartments in the model), mask-wearing, self-isolation, immunity, and death are implemented. The population size, simulated time period, proportion of agents wearing masks, and proportion of agents willing to self-isolate are customizable, and an optional simulation view implemented using the Pygame library is provided. This project is structured using a modified version of the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.
- **Abagio:** This project, written in Python using the Pygame library, is an in-progress recreation of the board game Abagio (based on an earlier project by me). The game is playable by 2 players using a GUI that includes animated dice, responsive instructions, smooth movement of game pieces (frogs), and rules for frog stacking and render priority. End-game conditions, passing, and the Top Frog rule are not currently implemented.
- **Project Constellation:** This is the repository for the Code4Community team of which I am a part. Since September 2023, I have used TypeScript, React, and the Chakra UI library to help build an online grant application form system for the charity This Star Won’t Go Out. This project is developed using Git, so my history of commits and pull requests for this project is publicly visible.
- **PBI Pricing Estimator:** This project, developed using Java Swing during an internship for Pressure BioSciences, Inc., enables the company to estimate the production cost and selling price of future products. Employees can enter values for a number of factors related to the production, shipping, and sale of the product into the GUI, and the program will validate the input values and calculate subtotal and total costs in real time as each input is updated. The current state of the program can be saved to a CSV file, and the validation settings for each input can also be customized and saved. *I do not have permission to share the code for this project, but a detailed description of the project with screenshots is provided in the README file.*
- **Reversi:** This is an implementation of the game Reversi played on a hexagonal board, developed with a partner in Java Swing for my Object-Oriented Design (CS3500) course in fall 2023. The game is played by two players, and each player has a separate window for selecting their moves. Each window always shows the up-to-date state of the game, as well as whether it is the corresponding player's turn, and both invalid move detection and win detection are implemented. Any combination of human and AI players can be used; 3 unique AI players were implemented within a strategy framework we created that allows AI strategies to be easily combined in different ways. The project is structured using the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture and makes extensive use of multiple design patterns that we learned during the course, including the strategy pattern and the observer pattern. *As per the request of the course staff, the repository for this project will remain private unless access is requested. Please reach out to me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-schu/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> if you would like to view the code for this project!*
